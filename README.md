# Teon Banek's Emacs configuration

This is my starting Emacs configuration. It will probably expand as I am learning Emacs.

Installation
------------
Remove (and backup) your `~/.emacs.d` directory then follow these steps:

  * Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/Th30n/emacs-config ~/.emacs.d`
  * After running Emacs you will get warnings which packages are missing and
    should be installed. (Installation of missing packages should probably be
    automatic.)
